                            The Quantum Computing Group (QCG), in collaboration with the Physics and Astronomy Club (PaAC), conducted a series of student seminars covering a wide range of topics in the field of Many Body Quantum Theory and its implications in the domain of Quantum Computation and Information. The event kicked off with an introductory talk on quantum physics and computation, followed by sessions on many body entanglement, fractional statistics, topological quantum computation and quantum error correction.

                            QCG conducted “Dead & Alive”, the annual Qiskit Fall Fest, in collaboration with IBM Qiskit, from 4th to 6th November 2022. The hackathon served to provide a platform for students to learn and explore the vast and intriguing domain of quantum computing through innovative projects and prompts. The hackathon was preceded by an introductory workshop on quantum computation and a hands-on workshop on Qiskit. Students participated in teams and worked on projects for over a day. The hackathon concluded with all teams presenting their work to the judges. Moreover, a separate challenge was created for the freshers who had recently joined the institute.

                            The workshop organised by QCG in association with AWS in the last week of August'22 was a huge success, receiving participation in large numbers from the IITR Junta. The workshop started with notable AWS instructors teaching from the root level and introducing the basics of quantum computing whilst simultaneously teaching its hands-on use cases the very same day. It was a quick jump from being introduced to the quantum computing world while having the opportunity to use Amazon Braket, a fully managed quantum computing service designed to help speed up scientific research and software development for quantum computing. The AWS interface was also simple to grasp and quite beginner friendly. Overall, this workshop proved to be a good learning curve for the attendees.

                            IITR Quantum Hackathon'21, organised by QCG IIT Roorkee and sponsored by IBM Quantum as a part of Qiskit Fall Fest, brought students with different backgrounds together from 16th-19th October 2021 to team up and build quantum computing projects using Qiskit. Brian Ingmanson from IBM Quantum conducted a workshop for the participants, giving an overview of quantum computing and IBM Quantum Labs with Qiskit. QCG covered some advanced concepts in quantum computing through interactive and hands-on workshops. The virtual hackathon began with participants forming teams and pitching ideas on the Qiskit Fall Fest platform. All the teams were required to create GitHub repositories of their projects and present their work to the judges. Read more about the event through this blog.
